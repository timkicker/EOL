<p align="center">An open-source license with ethical considerations</p>



Welcome to the official repository for the **Ethical Open License (EOL) 1.0**. This license is designed to empower developers by granting freedom to use, modify, and distribute software — while ensuring that such freedoms are exercised within ethical boundaries.

The entire LICENSE-File can be found **[HERE](./LICENSE)**

## Overview

The Ethical Open License (EOL) is not just another open source license. It goes beyond traditional licenses (like MIT or GPL) by incorporating ethical restrictions. While you have the freedom to build upon and share the software, you must refrain from using it in ways that violate fundamental ethical standards. In particular, the license explicitly prohibits applications that involve:

- **Mass Surveillance:** Prevents unauthorized or non-consensual monitoring and data collection.
- **Warfare and Oppressive Regimes:** Bars use in autonomous weapon systems or in any technology that supports the suppression of dissent.
- **Discrimination & Hate Speech:** Disallows practices that promote bias, hate, or exclusion based on race, gender, or other attributes.
- **Other Unethical Practices:** Any use that infringes on internationally recognized human rights benchmarks.

## Independent Ethics Review Board (IERB)

Enforcement of the Ethical Open License is overseen by an **Independent Ethics Review Board (IERB)**. The IERB is a diverse, multi-stakeholder body composed of:

- **Legal Experts:** Specialists in international law, intellectual property, and human rights.
- **Open Source Advocates:** Representatives from major open source communities.
- **Domain-Specific Ethicists:** Professionals in fields such as AI ethics and data privacy.

### IERB Responsibilities

- **Complaint Review:** Assess allegations of unethical use based on submitted evidence (e.g., code snippets, screenshots, documentation).
- **Enforcement:** Decide on cases of non-compliance and, if necessary, revoke license rights.
- **Transparency:** Publish redacted decisions and annual reports to maintain public trust.
- **Appeals:** Provide a clear and structured process for appeals through binding arbitration.

   - **Formal Review:** A detailed investigation and opportunity for response by the accused party.
   - **Remediation or Revocation:** If a violation is confirmed, a remedial plan must be implemented within 30 days, or the license rights may be terminated.
